# R_COVID19
Final project for STA441 at URI.
In December 2019, COVID-19 coronavirus was first identified in the Wuhan region of China. By
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized the COVID-19 outbreak as a
pandemic. A lot has happened in the months in between with major outbreaks in Iran, South
Korea, and Italy. We know that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, such as through
coughing, sneezing, or speaking. Can we see any effect from country-wide policies, like
shutdowns and quarantines? Through this project and the various research I put into it, I hope
to identify common trends in quarantine practices that have been beneficial in both countries
and in universities/states, as well as comparing different factors of COVID-19 to other
epidemics/pandemics/outbreaks such as Ebola, H1N1, and SARS.

So far, this project uses R to look at different trends/attributes and their correlation with the virus. 
More will be added in time.

The **RMarkdown File** has the entire project in it. All data used is in the **data** folder.
